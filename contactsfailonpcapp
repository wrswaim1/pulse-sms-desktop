I have been a loyal Pulse user, paid premium, for a while. Have emailed, posted, messaged a continual problem for a while with no response from customer/tech support.  The desktop app for PC fails constantly in its contact list. It does not mirror the app.
I have tried constantly to log in & out, even restarting the app to refresh it, same problem. PLEASE contact me to discuss this in detail and provide a fix at 281-795-3952, or email at <wrswaim@live.com>
Thank you
